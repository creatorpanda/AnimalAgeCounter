# AnimalAgeCounter
This is my first JavaScript project. It calculates the corresponding age of an animal, as if it was a human being ("ages.jpg"). I've also uploaded. The accuracy of the board didn't matter to me. It's all about the code, which has some "tricks" to avoid many **IF** statements.

In case you don't know what to do: Click on the green "Clone or Download" button, click "Download Zip". Unzip it and open "AnimalAgeCalculator.html".

Have fun! :D
